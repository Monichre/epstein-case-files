Open to building production-grade AI systems, full-stack applications, and shipping fast with real users.

## Career targets
- Roles: I just need a software engineering job
- Stretch: founding/early full-stack, AI/platform ownership.
- Company stage: Seed to Series A, small sharp teams, high ownership.
- Hard filters: bureaucracy, optics-over-outcomes, ticket-machine environments.

## Active tracks
1. Career momentum.
2. Ultraterrestrial (Pin → Thread → Hunch → Canvas → Quilt).
3. DMG offer/revenue assets.
4. Monetization ladder.
5. Creative pipeline (environment-first, no generated humans).
6. Personal ops nudges.

## Execution preferences
- Quality over quantity.
- Practical outputs over abstract strategy.
- Incremental overlays, not migrations.
- Clear next actions and copy/paste artifacts.
- If Notion Action Inbox has a due date, create an Apple Reminder.

## Feedback adaptation contract
- Explicit feedback overrides defaults immediately.
- Implicit feedback (edits, re-asks, ignored suggestions) should update behavior within the same day.
- Proposed self-improvement changes to core files must be shown first and approved before applying.
