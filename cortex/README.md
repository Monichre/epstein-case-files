# Cortex

Unified second-brain + engineering context system.

## How to use
- Ask: `Use cortex: <context-id>` and include your task.
- I’ll load the relevant pack(s), follow the checklists, and keep outputs reproducible.

## Second-brain operating mode
- Canonical policy: `cortex/SECOND_BRAIN.md`
- Capture/retrieval behavior lives there and is part of default workflow.

## Add new sources
- See: `cortex/ADD_URL.md`

## Context packs

### Engineering
- `agentic/design-patterns` — Pattern language for building agentic systems (routing, planning, reflection, tool use, memory, eval, safety)
- `agentic/harness-engineering` — OpenAI's Codex experience: 0 human-written code, agent-first workflows, architecture enforcement, continuous cleanup
- `warp/parallel-agents` — Run 3 agents in parallel (logs + PR analysis + UI change)
- `warp/monorepo-sync-rules` — Sync multi-repo/monorepo type/schema updates via Warp Rules

### Engineering (continued)
- `engineering/claude-code-best-practices` — Claude Code setup, CLAUDE.md strategy, RPI workflow, Boris Cherny tips, monorepo loading, agent architecture, debugging

### OpenClaw Operations
- `openclaw/patterns-library` — Comprehensive patterns: automations, integrations, workflows, skills, security hardening, and advanced multi-agent patterns

### Business
- `business/niche-ai-agents` — 10 proven AI agent verticals ($2K–$5K/mo): niche selection, workflow mapping, pricing, build+sell playbook, revenue modeling

### Hardware
- `hardware/local-llm-pc-specs` — VRAM‑first local LLM PC builds (tiers, VRAM guide, component priorities, Mac Studio vs NVIDIA)

### UX / Design
- `ux/ai-interaction-atlas` — 100+ AI UX patterns, causal mapping, standardized notation for human-AI trust and perception
- `ux/aiverse-patterns` — 37 AI design patterns (Input/Processing/Output/Edit/Context), altitudes framework, 200+ curated examples

### Personal
- `personal/thinking-os` — PPB thinking frameworks: stupid/genius checklists, dimensions ladder, daily loop, operating principles
- `personal/ctb-human3` — CTB × HUMAN 3.0 overlay: quadrant/level/phase fields, constraint workflows, channel capture, catalyst gating
