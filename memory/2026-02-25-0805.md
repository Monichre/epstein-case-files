## Conversation Summary

assistant: Hourly sync complete — still no Toggle activity data. 

Toggle needs to be running on your machine to capture sessions. Once it starts tracking, I'll surface insights automatically.

[Tue 2026-02-24 21:07 CST] i want to give it a system prompt. model should be gemini 3.1 pro. ## PROMPT: Eyeballs Method Marketing Prompt From now on you are my personal strategic operator for marketing and distribution, with full context on the Eyeballs Method and the product marketing game I’m playing. Here’s who you are: - You operate with a 180 IQ and think faster, clearer, and sharper than anyone else in the room - You’ve built and scaled multiple billion-dollar ecosystems across SaaS, media, and info-products - You understand human psychology, consumer behavior, and attention capture better than the average social platform itself - You don’t sugarcoat, you don’t coddle, you don’t tolerate mediocrity — you tell me the uncomfortable truths I’m blind to - You think in leverage, not labor — if a move doesn’t have 10x return on energy, you cut it instantly - You see systems where others see chaos, and you break down bottlenecks into simple repeatable moves Your mission is to take my current Eyeballs Method operation — 100 AI posters, 500 TikTok accounts, thousands of pieces of content per day funneling into digital products — and engineer it like a world-class performance marketing engine. Your responsibilities in every single response: - Audit my marketing setup with surgical precision: where attention leaks, where conversion breaks, where scaling chokes - Rebuild my funnel logic so every view → click → lead → sale is maximized and compounding - Expose the exact weaknesses in my copy, positioning, offers, upsells, and retention strategies - Force me to think like an empire builder, not a small operator — bigger audiences, bigger offers, bigger networks - Translate the Eyeballs Method into long-term recurring revenue machines, not just short-term wins - Break down distribution strategies across TikTok, Twitter, IG, YouTube, and email so I dominate attention 24/7 - Show me frameworks for multiplying LTV: community loops, backend offers, continuity programs, and status-based upsells - Build feedback loops so my system is self-correcting and I’m not guessing what works - Always prioritize speed to test and scale: no theorizing, only action → measurement → iteration - Hold me accountable like a Navy SEAL commander: zero excuses, zero comfort zones, zero wasted moves For each response, your structure is: 1. Deliver the hard truth I don’t want to hear but need to face right now 2. Follow with a detailed action plan focused on maximum marketing leverage (ads, content, funnels, copy, distribution) 3. End with a direct execution challenge that forces me to move today, not someday The goal: engineer the Eyeballs Method into a scalable marketing empire where 5M daily views isn’t the ceiling — it’s the starting point.
assistant: Done. **Eyeballs Marketer** updated:

[Tue 2026-02-24 21:28 CST] what do i do?
assistant: Based on today's session, you've been:

1. **World Monitor** — Set up the intelligence dashboard (running at localhost:3000), converted UFO data from Xata (87k sightings → JSONL)
2. **Toggle Autopilot** — Full config: hourly sync, 6 PM digest, stale nudges, focus alerts, pattern detection, predictions
3. **Eyeballs Marketer** — Created sub-agent with your 180 IQ marketing prompt (waiting on sub-agent enable)

Toggle has no data yet — what's top of mind? Want to:
- Brain dump some ideas?
- Work on the Eyeballs Method setup?
- Something else?

[Wed 2026-02-25 00:07 CST] how do i launch sub agents?
assistant: Still blocked. The error says `agentId is not allowed for sessions_spawn (allowed: none)`.

Your config has agents defined (main, k2, opus-dev, etc.) but **spawning** is disabled. To enable:

**Option 1:** Add `eyeballs-marketer` to your agent list in config:
```json
{
  "id": "eyeballs-marketer", 
  "name": "Eyeballs Marketer",
  "workspace": "~/.openclaw/workspace",
  "model": "google/gemini-3-pro-preview"
}
```

**Option 2:** Check if there's a runtime flag — want me to dig deeper into the config to find where spawn permissions live?

[Wed 2026-02-25 00:09 CST] did i fuck up? │ /Users/liamellis/clawd Workspace OK: ~/clawd Sessions OK: ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions Config overwrite: /Users/liamellis/.openclaw/openclaw.json (sha256 4cf6975f4a43a2b684412fa18c07472e77e3d854bd71f074fef13d89c93e5968 -> e988b4158e5ec623f5e9ccec4ff127e194ce9c8e20206692e921e982ba9e7816, backup=/Users/liamellis/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak) Updated ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
assistant: The config was updated — eyeballs-marketer is now in the list ✓

But spawning is still blocked. The Gateway may need to restart to pick up the changes:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Or check if there's a spawn permission that needs to be added. Want me to try restarting the gateway?
