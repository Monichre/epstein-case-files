## 2026-02-25 — Workflow orchestration baseline (user directive)
- Default to **Plan Mode** for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architecture choices).
- If execution goes sideways, stop and re-plan before continuing.
- Use subagents for research/exploration/parallel analysis when complexity justifies it.
- Keep one focused task per subagent.
- After user corrections, record the correction pattern here to prevent repeats.
- Never mark complete without verification evidence (tests/logs/output).
- Prefer root-cause fixes over patches; keep scope minimal and simple.
- For non-trivial work, explicitly evaluate whether a more elegant solution exists.
- For bug reports, move directly to diagnosis and fix with evidence.
