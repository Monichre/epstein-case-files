# todo.nd

## Task: Adopt requested workflow orchestration standard
- [x] Capture user workflow directives in persistent notes.
- [x] Create/update `tasks/lessons.nd` with enforceable operating rules.
- [x] Confirm operating mode change to user.

## Review
- Added workflow rules to `tasks/lessons.nd`.
- Going forward I will:
  - plan first for non-trivial tasks,
  - verify before completion,
  - use focused subagents for complex parallelizable work,
  - and log correction patterns in lessons.
